// Question: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called 
// make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. 
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


// Ans:
let magicians1: string[] = ["ainak wala jin" , "ram" , "hatoba"]

function  goodMagicians(magicians1:string[]){
    for(let i=0; i<magicians1.length; i++){
        magicians1[i] = magicians1[i] +  " the best "
        }
}

function showMagicians(magician:string[]){
    magician.forEach(element =>{
        console.log(element);
        
    })
}
goodMagicians(magicians1);
showMagicians(magicians1);
