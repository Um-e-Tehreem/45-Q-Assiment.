// Question: Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country. 
// The function should print a simple sentence, such as Karachi is in Pakistan. Give the parameter for the country
// a default value. Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default 
// country.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// Ans:
let karachi = "karachi is in pakistan";
let mumbai = "mumbai is in india";
let paris = "paris is in france";
function describeCity(city) {
    console.log(city);
}
console.log(karachi);
console.log(mumbai);
console.log(paris);
